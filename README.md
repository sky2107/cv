## Last 2 projects with Kerbbery GmbH

1. Project: CMS for Corona Testing Stations (Duration: 8 Months)

The CMS project was developed to manage and organize data for corona testing stations. It included features such as authentication using Identity Server Keycloak and a payment service. The main technology stack used for this project included Python (Fastapi), Swagger API documentation, dependency injection, and testing (pytest). The testing strategy included integration tests, unit tests, mocking of services, and testing the flow of the program. A CI/CD pipeline was also implemented using Gitlab, and databases were managed using Postgres and SQLLite. The project was hosted on a Hetzner server due to German laws surrounding sensitive and personal data, and a firewall and load balancer were used for added security. The Scrum process was used for agile development.

Some of the challenges faced during the project included understanding dependency injection and using sqlalchemy, and the documentation for the project was poor. The biggest issue encountered was with the implementation of the Keycloak authorization system, which was added after the system had already been developed.

If the project were to be started again from scratch, some improvements that could be made include:

- Increasing test coverage and conducting stress tests
- Using an image registry and versioning system, such as Gitlab
- Implementing monitoring in the production environment
- Utilizing Kubernetes and containerization technologies
- Improving the refactoring process and using merge requests
- Establishing acceptance criteria for completing tasks
- Developing a roadmap at the beginning of the project
- Improving documentation and creating UML diagrams and API diagrams
- Incorporating a stage for refactoring after each task is completed

Other areas for improvement include:

- Developing a logging strategy to identify and troubleshoot bugs
- Implementing logging for monitoring in production
- Logging important values such as performance and workload
- Gaining expertise in Kubernetes to create deployments with multiple nodes and using Statefulsets for databases
- Implementing a rollback system in case data is lost.
- Main Technology Stack: Backend - Python, Docker, Swagger, Keycloak, Postgres, Hetzner (cloud server), Gitlab
- Software Design Strategies: Repository pattern, OOP style.

2. Project: API Service with PUB/SUB System (Duration: 3 Months)

This project involved developing an API service that utilized a PUB/SUB system using Redis. The service implemented async/await and parallelism using coroutines for handling multiple uploads and downloads of images. A mail server and NoSQL database were also integrated. The project was containerized using Docker and the compose file.

Main Technology Stack: Backend - Python, Docker, Swagger, Mongo, Redis, Hetzner (cloud server), Github
